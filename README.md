Mapping international financial data by country

Scrapes Quandl's page of international stock indices with one module, at this point mostly just to obtain the one day performance of each index. The index is then matched with its home country, and the result is printed as a gradient of degree of change to a map of the world.


DISCLAIMER: These maps make zero claim to convey actionable financial information. This is more an exercise in how to plot data to a map using Python.
